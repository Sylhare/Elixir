# Elixir

## Getting started

Go to [elixir-lang.org](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

Elixir has an interactive prompt called `iex` that you can try on the commad line.

To run a script try with:
```bash
elixir hello.exs
```

To compile your module you should use `elixirc` such as
```bash
elixirc hello.exs
```

## Tips

There are no multiple comments line. A comments starts like in python with `#`

```elixir
# Will print Hello world
IO.puts "Hello world"
```
